# Skip ads - Chrome extension


Instantly skips any links from general ad websites and redirects to the actual site.

## Installation

## Supported domains

## How it works

This works by spoofing the User Agent of the browser, so that shorte.st believes that we are a crawler and redirects instead of showing ads.
